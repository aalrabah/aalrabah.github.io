# About Me
I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Prof. Abdussalam Alawini](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/alawini).

## Research Focus
My work explores AI-driven educational technology, with particular interests in:  
- Intelligent tutoring systems  
- Knowledge graph construction and visualization  
- Natural language processing for learning analytics  

Currently, I am building an intelligent tutoring platform that integrates course materials, SQL assessments, and personalized student feedback through interactive graph-based visualizations.

## Background
Before starting my PhD, I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from California State University, Northridge in 2013, after which I began my professional career as a Plant Engineer at Alkout Industrial Project in Kuwait (2013–2014), where I focused on improving plant efficiency and chemical processes. I then joined Baker Hughes (2014–2015) as a Field Engineer, working on drilling fluids optimization and geological data analysis. Building on this, I founded Gonuts Cronuts LLC (2016–2021), leading it as CEO and applying data analytics and ERP systems to scale operations across more than 70 outlets. Transitioning toward computing, I pursued graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, earning a Graduate Certificate (2023) and M.S. in Computer Science (2024). During this period, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant, developing AI-driven educational technologies such as CodeLens, and collaborated with NCSA on chatbot research. I also served as a Web Application Developer (2023) for the UIUC Department of Computer Science, gaining experience in full-stack and cloud-based development. My journey reflects a progression from engineering and entrepreneurship to advanced AI and educational technology research.

## Beyond Research
Outside of research, I enjoy [optional hobby/interest].
